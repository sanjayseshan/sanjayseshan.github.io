                        <p>My name is Sanjay. I am currently an undergraduate at MIT pursuing a Bachelor of Science
                            degree in
                            Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6-2). I graduate in Spring 2025.
                            Starting Fall
                            2025, I am planning to start my Doctoral studies (PhD) in an Electrical and Computer
                            Engineering
                            program, focusing on computer architecture and integrated circuits.</p>

                        <!-- I actively work with and am experienced with Java, Python, C, TensorFlow, SolidWorks, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, OpenCV, and Keras. -->

                        <p>
                            I am always looking for interesting work/research/internships in the realm of developing
                            electrical and
                            computer systems -- for example, CPU/GPU design, FPGA/ASICs, Integrated Circuits, Embedded
                            Systems.
                            My primary interest is in Computer Architecture. I enjoy developing novel systems, such as
                            working
                            on
                            parallelizing systems (CPUs) and developing on low powered devices. Much of my past research
                            and
                            internships have focused on the development of such computer systems, e.g. developing a
                            highly
                            multithreaded RISC-V CPU, implementing an application specific accelerators for graph
                            pattern
                            mining, utilizing processing in memory, and creating various interfaces on FPGAs or
                            simulation. I
                            also have interest in creating embedded systems for distributed IoT (Internet of Things)
                            sensing.
                            Some of my past work has involved developing extremely low powered and interconnected
                            sensing
                            systems.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <p>

                        I have worked to develop embedded systems, hardware accelerators, and explored areas in CPU
                        architecture in my recent work.

                            At MIT, my coursework has ranged from programming low-level systems to CPU design to
                            semiconductor
                            device fabrication. I have taken classes in
                            Circuits, Signal Processing, Computer Architecture, FPGA-focused digital design, and
                            microcomputer
                            (embedded) systems development. I also have taken a fabrication class for developing
                            nanoscale
                            systems, including with novel materials for transistors (e.g. MoS<sub>2</sub>). Through my
                            semiconductor coursework, I have experience with the
                            layout process for mixed signal systems for Intel's 22nm silicon tapeout.

                            of the official software from LEGO. I have also been learning French, since I spent a summer
                            in the
                            French-speaking side of Switzerland. Minor planet 33762 is named after me, Sanjayseshan.

                            I also enjoy travelling and taking pictures with a Nikon DSLR. I also take photos from
                            events
                            (formals,
                            graduation, etc.). I maintain a selection of <a

                        I began my own website, EV3Lessons in 2014 and started teaching other children how to program LEGO robots. Today, I have a million users across all my websites and community groups. I have been invited by The LEGO Group and LEGO Education
                        to participate in numerous events and conferences around the world to inspire others and share my knowledge. This expertise led to becoming a technical editor for a LEGO robotics book. Most recently, I was invited to the First 5, a
                        group of 5 community members to help design and test a brand new LEGO robotics platform called SPIKE Prime. This product was launched in January 2020.

                    <p>I spent 10 years in FIRST Robotics, before and during high school (2010-2020). My team won the highest award in the program - World Champion's in 2018. I participated in FIRST LEGO League and FIRST Robotics Competition, for which I was
                        the lead programmer and captain of my team(s).</p>

                    <p>I also participated in science fairs between 2016 and 2021. I am both a Broadcom MASTERS finalist and an Intel ISEF finalist. These are the premiere international science fairs for students. All my projects were related to computer science
                        and engineering. My projects can be found in the Portfolio page.

                                <p>Abstract—With the application of graphs in large-scale modeling, such as social
                                    network analysis and image and video
                                    segmentation, among other applications, graphs are increasingly
                                    being used to encode and find complex relationships between data
                                    for machine learning models, leading to an increased need for
                                    optimization of these models. As a result, in order to better support model-specific
                                    algorithm efficiency, there has been work to
                                    create specialized hardware accelerators focusing on aspects such
                                    as memory accessing, latency, and resource allocation. However,
                                    current accelerators for graph problems are not scalable and can
                                    only be optimized for a single application, such as graph random
                                    walks or matrix multiplication. Existing systems also run on CPU
                                    or GPUs. Following from prior accelerator work on FPGAs, we
                                    plan to implement a graph-based vector search algorithm, based
                                    on iQAN, that runs on an FPGA to produce better algorithm
                                    performance than on existing systems and can be used for more
                                    versatile applications.</p>

                                    analysis.
                                    Paper at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13322">ArXiv.2009.13322</a>.<br><br>
                                    The goal of this project is to create an inexpensive, lightweight, wearable
                                    assistive device that can measure hand or finger movements accurately enough to
                                    identify a range of hand gestures. One eventual application is to provide assistive
                                    technology and sign language detection for the hearing impaired. My system, called
                                    LiTe (Light-based Technology), uses optical fibers embedded into a wristband. The
                                    wrist is an optimal place for the band since the light propagation in the optical
                                    fibers is impacted even by the slight movements of the tendons in the wrist when
                                    gestures are performed. The prototype incorporates light dependent resistors to
                                    measure these light propagation changes. When creating LiTe, I considered a variety
                                    of fiber materials, light frequencies, and physical shapes to optimize the tendon
                                    movement detection so that it can be accurately correlated with different gestures.
                                    I implemented and evaluated two approaches for gesture recognition. The first uses
                                    an algorithm that combines moving averages of sensor readings with gesture sensor
                                    reading signatures to determine the current gesture. The second uses a neural
                                    network trained on a labelled set of gesture readings to recognize gestures. Using
                                    the signature-based approach, I was able to achieve a 99.8% accuracy at recognizing
                                    distinct gestures. Using the neural network the recognition accuracy was 98.8%. This
                                    shows that high accuracy is feasible using both approaches. The results indicate
                                    that this novel method of using fiber optics-based sensors is a promising first step
                                    to creating a gesture recognition system. </p>

                                    predict that demand for autonomous vehicles will increase tenfold between 2019 and
                                    2026. However, recent high-profile accidents have significantly impacted consumer
                                    confidence in this technology. The cause for many of these accidents can be traced
                                    back to the inability of these vehicles to correctly sense the impending danger. In
                                    response, manufacturers have been improving the already extensive on-vehicle sensor
                                    packages to ensure that the system always has access to the data necessary to ensure
                                    safe navigation. However, these sensor packages only provide a view from the
                                    vehicle's perspective and, as a result, autonomous vehicles still require frequent
                                    human intervention to ensure safety.
                                    To address this issue, I developed a system, called Horus, that combines on-vehicle
                                    and infrastructure-based sensors to provide a more complete view of the environment,
                                    including areas not visible from the vehicle. I built a small-scale experimental
                                    testbed as a proof of concept. My measurements of the impact of sensor failures
                                    showed that even short outages (1 second) at slow speeds (25 km/hr scaled velocity)
                                    prevents vehicles that rely on on-vehicle sensors from navigating properly. My
                                    experiments also showed that Horus dramatically improves driving safety and that the
                                    sensor fusion algorithm selected plays a significant role in the quality of the
                                    navigation. With just a pair of infrastructure sensors, Horus could tolerate sensors
                                    that fail 40% of the time and still navigate safely. These results are a promising
                                    first step towards safer autonomous vehicles. </p>

                                    Each day, there are 850 water main breaks in the US. Early detection of leaks is critical to managing costs and saving water. I did a case study on my own local township and learnt that around 20% of water is unaccounted for, but this is a relatively low number as in some regions this number can reach up to 40%. Unfortunately, all the existing solutions to detect leakages in pipes require a leak to already be present, causing all the water to still be lost. Therefore, my goal was to detect the leaking water by detecting pipe deterioration before there is an actual break and water is lost. To do this, I used the acoustic properties of pipes to infer damage. <a

                                signatures to determine the current gesture. The
                                second uses a neural network trained on a labelled set of gesture readings to recognize
                                gestures.</li> -->
