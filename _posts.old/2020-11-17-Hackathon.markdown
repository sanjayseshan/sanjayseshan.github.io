<p>On November 13-14, 110 students from 11 countries competed in a virtual Hackathon that I hosted. FCHacks ran for 24 hours from Friday evening to Saturday evening eastern time (from my bedroom). I am very happy with how the event turned out.

<p>Because of COVID-19, I had contacted my school principal over the summer and asked to move the entire event to a virtual environment. I developed the entire backend registration and submission process as well. Since it was all online, I got permission from my school to open it up to anyone, even homeschoolers and students in other states and countries. </p>

<p> More than 22 volunteers from all over the United States mentored the students and ran workshops for them all weekend. The theme of the event was Hacking Healthcare which was revealed only on the day of the event. Students were given 24 hours to come up with a technology solution to a solve any problem in healthcare. Several teams tackled COVID-19 related projects. Some students created websites that diagnose illnesses and promote social health. Others made apps to calculate BMI or provide exercise recommendations. Other teams focused on tracking eating habits. There was a wonderful variety of projects and types of solutions.</p>
