<p>I have been participating in robotics since 2011. I started out in FIRST LEGO League, an international competition for students ages 9-16 using LEGO robotics. Since 2018, I have been building and programming large metal robotics in the FIRST Robotics Competition program.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Deans List</h2>

<p>I was a named a Dean's List semi-finalist in 2020 by my team. This award for a student who best embodies the entire program. I was honored to be chosen.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Rookie All-Star</h2>

<p>We competed in Dayton, Ohio in March 2020. This was the first event of the season. It was an incredible first experience for us. We did incredibly well given our first tournament. We scored in every match (more than veteran teams). We ended up winning the Rookie All-Star Award and were selected to attend World Championships in April 2020. It is unfortunate that World Championships had to be cancelled this year. Nevertheless, I had a enjoyed the season and felt that we learned a lot. </p>
