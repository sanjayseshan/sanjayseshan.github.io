Science fairs are all about asking questions and seeking answers. Participating in science fairs fit right in with my interests in robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Why Science Fairs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having experienced the FIRST LEGO League research project, I found it to be very similar - come up with a question. Develop a way to test a solution and share your results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My very first year in Science Fair, I got a third place award at PRSEF (Pittsburgh Regional Science and Engineering Fair). This is the premier science fair and only qualifying fair for national and international events. However, I did not know any of this at the time. I was content with my third place first performance. Then, at the start of my Freshman year, I received notification that I had qualified as a Broadcom MASTERS finalist (Top 30). This won me an all-expenses paid week in Washington D.C. to compete at the national level.  I received $500, $1000 for my school and even had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=33762#content&quot;&gt;minor planet&lt;/a&gt; named for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just the start. I have competed in science fairs ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would strongly encourage others to participate as well. You learn not just how to be a scientist, but you also learn how to communicate better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Failure is an Option&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the popular quotation, failure is an option. This is exactly what you learn in the FIRST program. It is okay to try and then fail and then try again. This is something I have learnt through my nine years in FIRST. In the 2018-19 season, I was on the Leadership Team and the Lead Programmer for FRC SHARP. Starting the 2018-19 season, I will be co-captain and Lead Programmer of my own FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team.&lt;/p&gt;

I have taken many little steps towards this goal.
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started when a High School all-girls robotics team asked my brother and I if we would come teach a camp for them. We agreed. The result was &quot;10 Easy Lessons&quot;, a complete set of beginner lessons written for the LEGO MINDTORMS EV3 product.&amp;gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Next Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every milestone acheived....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This soon led to an interest in photography and now I am even taking a photography class at my high school. I hope to keep developing this skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Why do I enjoy it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A picture can sometimes be worth a thousand words. I find that people pay more attention to the text when you have a picture accompanying it. A photo helps to explain a project better. It helps to share the beauty of the world. It helps to remember the places you have been and the experiences you have had, and share that with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The cover photo on this page was taken in a market in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt;

To date, I have been to Mexico, Costa Rica, Thailand, India, Singapore, China, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Turkey, Denmark and Canada. The cover photo above was taken on a small street in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It is hard to pick a favorite moment. I have loved walking down the empty streets of Pompeii imagining what life in Ancient Rome may have been like to experiencing the opulence of the palace at Versaille. I have loved chatting with a monk in Thailand about Buddhism, to sharing a meal with a Costa Rican family. Perhaps experiencing the coldest cold during a blizzard in Iceland is one I will never forget. Each country and each city brings a whole new set of experiences!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Go to the places the locals do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother taught me when I was young to enjoy a country. Yes, see the sights you must see, but don't be afraid to go off the beaten path and explore. The best way to see a place is to walk. On your way to a destination, you might get side-tracked or even lost. However, it is in getting lost that you find the most amazing sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This past February, I had exactly 30 hours to spend in Istanbul. Tired and jet-lagged though I was, I knew that this was an opportunity not to be lost. I had read about Constantinople in my AP World History class, but to see and experience this history was an opportunity of a lifetime. I told my family that I did not mind if I was tired. I wanted to see everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/img/SanjayTurkey.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;In Istanbul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we wandered the city on foot for 30 hours. In 30 hours I discovered the beauty of Istanbul - history written into the stone itself at the Hajia Sophia, the remains of a Roman Aqueduct, now traversed by busses and taxis, Mosques that provided safe refuge for itinerant travelers and the aroma of spices which brought them there. Being there taught me far more than my history book every could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;A passion for history&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since I spend a lot of time on STEM subjects, it might be surprising that I like history. I have been lucky enough to get to travel to many historical sites. My parents took me to National Parks and historical cities growing up. Going to visit places such as Pompeii, the Red Fort, or Monticello excite me. And yes, I enjoy history museums too.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Photo taken on a school field trip to Gettysburg&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Why History?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Last summer, I had to read a book about King Leopold in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While we hear about the genocide of Jewish people in World War II, rarely do we hear about the genocide that took place in the Africa. I was shocked this story was also not part of our common knowledge. How many other places around the world have faced the same atrocities? We need to study history and talk about our past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to start a History Club at my high school during my sophomore year. Most of the members are students from my AP World History class. We play historical boardgames, watch historical movies, have discussions on topics and are planning a field trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love traveling to historical sites, but I also have an interest in technological history. I enjoy museum exhibits displaying tools and technology of ancient and not-so-ancient people. On a trip to Costa Rica, I discovered a very unique collection of modern, but old technology in the back of a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
