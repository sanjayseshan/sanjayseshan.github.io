<!-- description: This is who I am -->

<p>My name is Sanjay. I am currently a Freshman at MIT (Class of 2025), studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6).</p>

<!-- I actively work with and am experienced with Java, Python, C, TensorFlow, SolidWorks, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, OpenCV, and Keras. -->

<p>I have been programming small LEGO robots for almost a decade now. I was invited by The LEGO Group to become one of the youngest ever MINDSTORMS Community Partners (MCP), a small group of experts invited to collaborate with LEGO on projects. I began my own website, EV3Lessons in 2014 and started teaching other children how to program LEGO robots. Today, I have a million users across all my websites and community groups. I have been invited by The LEGO Group and LEGO Education to participate in numerous events and conferences around the world to inspire others and share my knowledge. This expertise led to becoming a technical editor for a LEGO robotics book. Most recently, I was invited to the First 5, a group of 5 community members to help design and test a brand new LEGO robotics platform called SPIKE Prime. This product was launched in January 2020. 
  <!-- I now also run a website called primelessons.org which hosts programming lessons for SPIKE Prime. -->
</p>

<p>I spent 10 years in FIRST Robotics, before and during high school (2010-2020). My team won the highest award in the program - World Championâ€™s in 2018. I participated in FIRST LEGO League and FIRST Robotics Competition, for which I was the lead programmer and captain of my team(s).</p>

<p>I also participated in science fairs between 2016 and 2021. I am both a Broadcom MASTERS finalist and an INTEL ISEF finalist. These are the premiere international science fairs for students. All my projects were related to computer science and engineering. My projects can be found in the Portfolio page.</p>

<!-- <p>For fun, I enjoy traveling and taking photographs. Majority of the photographs on this website were taken by me. I love experiencing the sights and sounds of a new country and studying its history. While I have been involved in robotics and science fairs, I actually also enjoy history. I founded the History Club at my high school. You can read my blog post on the subject.</p> -->
