<p>My name is Sanjay. Most people who know me would say that I am passionate about robotics, programming and STEM education.</p>

<p>I have been programming small LEGO robots for almost a decade now. Within five years, I became an expert in the field. I was invited by The LEGO Group to become one of the youngest ever MINDSTORMS Community Partners (MCP), a small group of experts invited to collaborate with LEGO on projects. I began my own website, EV3Lessons in 2014 and started teaching other children how to program LEGO robots. Today, I have over 400,000 users in 175 countries. I have been invited by The LEGO Group and LEGO Education to participate in numerous events and conferences around the world to inspire others and share my knowledge. This expertise led to becoming a technical editor for a LEGO robotics book. Most recently, I was invited to the First 5, a group of 5 community members to help design and test a brand new LEGO robotics platform called SPIKE Prime. This product was launched in April 2019. </p>

<p>2020 marks my tenth year in FIRST robotics. My team won the highest award in the program - World Championâ€™s in 2018. From LEGO robots, I became interested in large metal robots in FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2018, I joined an FRC team and became the Lead Programmer within months. I founded a team in 2019 and I am the Team Co-Captain and the Lead Programmer. FIRST Robotics is an amazing activity because it teaches engineers to collaborate, trust and also respect each other. </p>

<p>When I am not with my robotics team, I am most likely conducting a science experiment. I have been participating in science fairs since eight grade. I am both a Broadcom MASTERS finalist and an INTEL ISEF finalist. These are the premiere international science fairs for students.</p>

<p>For fun, I enjoy traveling and taking photographs. All the photographs on this website were taken by me. I love experiencing the sights and sounds of a new country and studying its history. While I have been involved in robotics and science fairs, I actually also enjoy history. I founded the History Club at my high school. You can read my blog post on the subject.</p>
