<p>I have been participating in science fairs for many years now. Science fairs are all about asking questions and seeking answers.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why Science Fairs?</h2>

<p>My very first year in Science Fair, I got a third place award at PRSEF (Pittsburgh Regional Science and Engineering Fair). This is the premier science fair and only qualifying fair for national and international events. However, I did not know any of this at the time. I was content with my third place performance. Then, at the start of my Freshman year, I received notification that I had qualified as a Broadcom MASTERS finalist (Top 30 out of 80,000 science fair projects). This won me an all-expenses paid week in Washington D.C. to compete at the national level.  I received $500, $1000 for my school and even had a <a href= "https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=33762#content">minor planet</a> named for me.</p>

<p>This was just the start. I have competed in science fairs ever since. In my sophomore year, I was the ISEF Finalist from my region and selected to go to Arizona to attend Intel ISEF. Unfortunately, our March 2020 fair got cancelled. I was able to present my work at PJAS the month before.</p>
