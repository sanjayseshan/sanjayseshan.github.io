<p>The is no denying that I have been interested in programming and robotics since the very first time I was introduced to it. That was over 10 years ago when I went to visit a FIRST LEGO League state championship event as a spectator. The next fall, I had a team. Seven years later, that team won the highest award in FIRST LEGO League, the World Champion's award. Along the journey, many amazing things happened to me.</p>

<p>I have been involved in FIRST robotics for the last 9 years. I have been a competitor, a mentor, and a coach. In the 2018-19 season, I was on the Leadership Team and the Lead Programmer for FRC SHARP. Starting the 2018-19 season, I will be co-captain and Lead Programmer of my own FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team. One of the main lessons you learn through the FIRST program is not to give up. Failure is part of the process of learning.</p>
