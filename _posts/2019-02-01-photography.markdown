<p>I started my taking photographs of my robotics projects and on robotics trips. This soon led to an interest in photography and now I am even taking a photography class at my high school. I hope to keep developing this skill.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why do I enjoy it?</h2>

<p> A picture can sometimes be worth a thousand words. I find that people pay more attention to the text when you have a picture accompanying it. A photo helps to explain a project better. It helps to share the beauty of the world. It helps to remember the places you have been and the experiences you have had, and share that with someone else.</p>

<p> I think capturing memories for my family and friends is probably the best part. I took a camera to my Ultimate Frisbee game and took pictures of my teammates as a memory for them. </p>

<p> The cover photo on this page was taken in a market in Istanbul. </p>
