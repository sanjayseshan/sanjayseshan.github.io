<p>All students should learn to code, even if they do not intend to become computer scientists. It is a 21st century skill. As the Chapter Head for Steel City Codes, the Vice President of the Hacking & Coding Club and Lead Organizer for FCHacks, I am excited to have to opportunity to make coding fun.</p>

<p>FCHacks is a student-led Hackathon. Our spring 2020 event was unfortunately cancelled. This school year, I am the lead organizer for the event. As the head of FCHacks, I have done everything from working with the school principal, to filling grants, to creating the website to creating the back end system for the participants.</p>

<p>Because I knew that COVID-19 would most likely not be gone this school year, I negotiated with the high school principal over the summer to create an all-virtual fall event. This allows us to guarantee that we will have an event and also extend the invitation to participate beyond nearby schools.</p>

<p> I have been responsible from everything from writing grants to coordinating workshops and guest speakers. It has been a tremendous experience to coordinate the event. </p>
