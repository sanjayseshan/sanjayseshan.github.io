<p>I have a big goal - to expand STEM opportunities. I have taken many steps towards achieving this goal.
<h2 class="section-heading">The Beginning</h2>

<p>It all started when a High School all-girls robotics team asked my brother and I if we would come teach a camp for them in 2014. We agreed. We not only taught the camp, but created the lessons for it. The result was "10 Easy Lessons", a complete set of beginner lessons written for the LEGO MINDTORMS EV3 product. </p>

<p> Since then, I have found the Robotics Tutorials Network, a network of websites that educate and support more than 400,000 students around the world. </p>
