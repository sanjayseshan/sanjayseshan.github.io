<p>I took the photograph above at the National Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. Something about the man with beard under a sign reminding us the importance of history struck me.

<h2 class="section-heading">A passion for history</h2>

<p> Since I spend a lot of time on STEM subjects, it might be surprising that I like history. I have been lucky enough to get to travel to many historical sites. My parents took me to National Parks and historical cities growing up. Going to visit places such as Pompeii, the Red Fort, or Monticello excite me. And yes, I enjoy history museums too.

<h2 class="section-heading">Why History?</h2>
<p> Last summer, I had to read a book about King Leopold in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While we hear about the genocide of Jewish people in World War II, rarely do we hear about the genocide that took place in the Africa. I was shocked this story was also not part of our common knowledge. How many other places around the world have faced the same atrocities? We need to study history and talk about our past.

<p>I decided to start a History Club at my high school during my sophomore year. Most of the members are also students from my AP World History class. We play historical boardgames, watch historical movies, have discussions on topics and are planning a field trip. We even help each other study for tests.</p>

<p>I love traveling to historical sites, but I also have an interest in technological history. I enjoy museum exhibits displaying tools and technology of ancient and not-so-ancient people. On a trip to Costa Rica, I discovered a very unique collection of modern, but old technology in the back of a restaurant.</p>
