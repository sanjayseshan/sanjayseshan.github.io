<p>Since 2015, I have had a goal of creating my own non-profit and today, that became a reality!
<h2 class="section-heading">The Beginning</h2>

<p>It all started in 2014, when I began writing programming lessons for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. I taught these classes at a week-long camp. At the end of the camp, I created my very first website and published those lessons as "10 Easy Lessons", a complete set of beginner lessons. The request to download the lessons started growing each week. In addition, I provided email support, answering questions for any users. Then came the emails asking if I had any more lessons. That was the beginning of something huge. I started writing one new lesson each week. By April 2015, the number of users had grown to well over 3,000. The lessons grew too. Today, I have 100s of lessons and 1,000,000 users worldwide. </p>

<p> On my 18th birthday, I filed an application to become a non-profit. It was something I have been wanting to do for a long time. However, I wanted it to be my initiative and not my parents'. Therefore, I waited. I am excited to share that <a href="http://droidsrobotics.org">Droids Robotics</a> is now incorporated in Pennsylvania. I am waiting for my 501(c)(3) to be processed. In the mean time, I have established a Board and written ByLaws. </p>
