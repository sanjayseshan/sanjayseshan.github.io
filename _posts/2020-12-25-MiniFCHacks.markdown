<p>On December 23rd, the last day of school before Winter Break, I ran a three hour Hackathon to raise money for our local library. I asked participants to donate $5. Earlier in the week, I had also hosted a Math Contest and a History Quiz Contest virtually to raise money.</p>

<p>Since most of the participants for mini-FCHacks were elementary school students, I decide to simplify the process. We told all students to create a holiday or winter-themed game. My collaborators and I each ran a 40min tutorial on how to make games in Scratch and Python before the students began working. </p>

<p> I am tremendously happy with how much the students accomplished in just an hour or two of work. I already have permission from my school principal to run a full Hackathon for all our elementary schools in February.</p>
